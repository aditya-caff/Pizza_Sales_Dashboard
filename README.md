🚀 Pizza Sales Analysis Project 🍕📊

Delighted to share my latest Data Analytics project: "Pizza Sales Report Analysis". This dashboard provides actionable insights into pizza sales performance across revenue, orders, and category preferences.

🔍 Key Highlights:
Top Performer: Thai Chicken Pizza contributed the highest revenue at $43K.
Sales Leader: Classic Deluxe Pizza leads in both quantity sold and total orders placed.
Customer Favorites: Fridays and Saturdays saw the highest orders, peaking in July and January.
Revenue Drivers: Large-sized pizzas dominate, contributing 46% of total sales.
📈 Actionable Insights:
1️⃣ Focus promotions on low-performing pizzas (e.g., Brie Carre Pizza).
2️⃣ Leverage weekend trends with special campaigns to boost sales further.
3️⃣ Optimize the Classic category offerings to sustain high performance.
4️⃣ Introduce deals for medium-sized pizzas to balance customer preferences.

With tools like Power BI, I was able to extract actionable insights and create a visually compelling report to drive strategic decisions.
